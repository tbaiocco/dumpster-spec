- Change Twilio by Meta API Cloud???
    Example of 20 users, 12 msg/day average: Twilio 67.15 Meta 30
    
- send security code for frontend login via Telegram or WhatsApp (maybe email)

- Dashboard for the users
    Should be able to search the dumps, simply, with natural lang
    Should enable users to update the dumps, not only accept/reject but enable corrections
    Should enable category creation, and use those in the categorization mechanism
    Should present a dashboard ordered by date and priority of the dumps, showing by day, week and month (like: actions for today, tomorrow, then dates). In day view the next days appear collapsed but with a button to show, same happens in week and month view, in order to load the next actions in time
    Should also have views for Reminders and Tracking items, using same ordering idea of dumps (mainly by due-date, with day, week, month views)
    Should have feedback management, to send, view and manage feedbacks of the app
