- change the phoneNumberRegistration (telegram/whatsapp):
    Registration is the website, DON'T create users when sending message via bot Telegram/WhatsApp
    NOT NEEDED: to request if the new user wants to add his/her email to receive the digests and reminders.

- Change Twilio by Meta API Cloud???
    Example of 20 users, 12 msg/day average: Twilio 67.15 Meta 30
    
- send security code for frontend login via Telegram or WhatsApp (maybe email)

- Feedbacks must be persisted, first in DATABASE
    /home/baiocte/personal/dumpster/backend/src/modules/feedback/feedback.service.ts

- Tracking feature is not used/connected to anything.
    It must be used when receiving a new dump that is time-sensitive (package deliveries, applications, subscriptions, warranties, etc)
    persist?
    send specific section/reminder for these?
    In the digest, a section like: Packages/deliveries arriving today

- Dashboard for the users
    Should be able to search the dumps, simply, with natural lang
    Should enable users to update the dumps, not only accept/reject but enable corrections
    Should enable category creation, and use those in the categorization mechanism
    Should present a dashboard ordered by date and priority of the dumps, showing by day, week and month (like: actions for today, tomorrow, then dates). In day view the next days appear collapsed but with a button to show, same happens in week and month view, in order to load the next actions in time

- E-mail dumps: DONE
    The user can forward mails to create dumps from them, with images, docs, etc
    Existing webhook in email.controller.ts, missing the config GMAIL_API_SETUP.md for development and SENDGRID_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md for prod.

- Calendar integration?
    Checking calendar to detect possible conflicts, suggest changes
    2-way integration: reading and writting

- Agentic personas?
    Identify which agents are important, order them by priority to implement and when to introduce them
