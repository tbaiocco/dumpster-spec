    send specific section/reminder for these?
    In the digest, a section like: Packages/deliveries arriving today

- Dashboard for the users
    Should be able to search the dumps, simply, with natural lang
    Should enable users to update the dumps, not only accept/reject but enable corrections
    Should enable category creation, and use those in the categorization mechanism
    Should present a dashboard ordered by date and priority of the dumps, showing by day, week and month (like: actions for today, tomorrow, then dates). In day view the next days appear collapsed but with a button to show, same happens in week and month view, in order to load the next actions in time

- E-mail dumps
    The user can forward mails to create dumps from them, with images, docs, etc

- Calendar integration?
    Checking calendar to detect possible conflicts, suggest changes
    2-way integration: reading and writting

- Agentic personas?
    Identify which agents are important, order them by priority to implement and when to introduce them
