# Tasks: Clutter.AI Universal Life Inbox

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-universal-life-inbox/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: No explicit test requirements found in specifications - focusing on implementation tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
Based on plan.md structure: `backend/src/`, `admin-dashboard/src/`

## Dependencies & Execution Strategy

### User Story Completion Order
```
Phase 1 (Setup) ‚Üí Phase 2 (Foundation) ‚Üí Phase 3 (US1) ‚Üí Phase 4 (US2) ‚Üí Phase 5 (US4) ‚Üí Phase 6 (US5) ‚Üí Phase 7 (US3) ‚Üí Phase 8 (Admin) ‚Üí Phase 9 (Polish)
```

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within Phase 2 (Foundation)**: Tasks T011-T014 (entities), T016-T017 (auth), T018-T021 (config) can run in parallel

**Within Phase 3 (US1)**: Tasks T022-T029 (controllers and AI services) can run in parallel, then T030-T039 depend on earlier completion

**Within Phase 4 (US2)**: Tasks T040-T043 (search infrastructure) can run in parallel, then T044-T049 depend on search foundation

### Independent Test Criteria

- **US1**: Can send text/voice/image to bot and receive categorized AI response
- **US2**: Can search for dumped content using natural language and get relevant results  
- **US3**: Receives scheduled digests and proactive reminders based on content
- **US4**: Can report AI errors and system gracefully handles failures
- **US5**: All content types (email, screenshots, documents) are processed correctly

### MVP Scope Recommendation

**Suggested MVP**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1 only)
- Core content capture and AI processing
- Basic bot interaction with confirmation responses
- Foundation for all other features

This provides immediate value while establishing the technical foundation for incremental feature delivery.
