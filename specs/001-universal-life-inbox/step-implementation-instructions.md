## üõ†Ô∏è **Best Practices for Implementation Requests**

### **Start with MVP Scope**
```
"Let's start implementing the MVP - Phase 1 and Phase 2"
"Implement the foundation tasks (T001-T021) so we can begin user stories"
"Build the complete MVP: Phases 1-3 (tasks T001-T039)"
```

### **Follow Dependencies**
```
"I want to implement User Story 1, but make sure all prerequisites are done first"
"Start with setup and foundation, then move to basic capture functionality"
"Implement Phase 2 before starting any user story work"
```

### **Parallel Execution**
```
"Implement all the [P] tasks in Phase 3 that can run in parallel"
"Work on T022, T023, T024 simultaneously since they're marked parallel"
"Build all the entity classes (T011-T014) in parallel"
```

### **Incremental Development**
```
"Implement one user story at a time, starting with US1"
"Build and test Phase 3 before moving to Phase 4"
"Complete the MVP (Phases 1-3) before adding search functionality"
```

## ‚ö° **Quick Start Commands**

### **Get Started Immediately**
```
"Let's implement the MVP foundation - Phase 1 and Phase 2"
```

### **Build Complete MVP**
```
"Implement Phases 1-3 for a working MVP"
```

### **Add Search to MVP**
```
"We have MVP working, now add Phase 4 for search functionality"
```

### **Single Task Implementation**
```
"Implement task T001 to create the project structure"
```

### **Parallel Development**
```
"Implement all [P] marked tasks in Phase 2 that can run in parallel"
```

## üîß **Troubleshooting Implementation Requests**

### **If Dependencies Missing**
```
"Before implementing User Story 1, make sure Phase 2 foundation is complete"
"Check that tasks T009-T021 are done before starting T022"
```

### **If Scope Too Large**
```
"Just implement the database entities (T011-T014) for now"
"Let's start with just the Telegram bot (T025, T031) before WhatsApp"
```

### **If Need Clarification**
```
"Show me what tasks are in Phase 3"
"What are the prerequisites for implementing search functionality?"
"Which tasks can I run in parallel in Phase 2?"
```

## üìä **Progress Tracking**

### **Check Completion Status**
```
"Show me which tasks in Phase 1 are complete"
"What's the status of User Story 1 implementation?"
"How many tasks are left in the MVP scope?"
```

### **Validate Implementation**
```
"Test that Phase 2 foundation is working correctly"
"Verify User Story 1 meets the acceptance criteria"
"Run the independent test for search functionality"
```

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

Each phase and user story has clear success criteria:

- **Phase 1-2**: Infrastructure runs locally with database connection
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: Can send content to bot and receive AI confirmation
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: Can search dumped content with natural language
- **Phase 5 (US4)**: Can report errors and system handles gracefully
- **Phase 6 (US5)**: Can process voice, images, and documents
- **Phase 7 (US3)**: Receives scheduled digests and reminders
- **Phase 8**: Admin can manage users and monitor system
- **Phase 9**: System is production-ready and secure
