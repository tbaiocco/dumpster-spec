# SpecKit Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Code MUST be readable, maintainable, and follow established conventions. Every feature requires clear documentation, consistent naming patterns, and adherence to language-specific style guides. Code reviews MUST verify compliance with quality standards before merge. Technical debt MUST be tracked and addressed systematically, not accumulated indefinitely.

### II. Testing Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Comprehensive testing is mandatory across all layers. Unit tests MUST cover core logic with ≥80% coverage. Integration tests MUST validate feature interactions and external dependencies. Contract tests MUST verify API specifications and data models. Test-driven development is strongly encouraged for complex features to ensure testable design.

### III. User Experience Consistency
User interfaces and interactions MUST maintain consistency across all features and platforms. Design patterns, terminology, error messages, and workflows MUST follow established conventions. UX decisions MUST be documented and validated against user scenarios. Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA) MUST be met for all user-facing features.

### IV. Performance Standards
System performance MUST meet measurable benchmarks. Response times MUST be ≤200ms for interactive operations and ≤2s for complex queries. Memory usage MUST be monitored and optimized. Performance regressions MUST be detected and addressed before deployment. Load testing MUST validate system behavior under expected usage patterns.

### V. Evolution and Backward Compatibility
Feature evolution MUST preserve backward compatibility or provide clear migration paths. Breaking changes require explicit justification, impact assessment, and user communication. Versioning MUST follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). API changes MUST maintain compatibility for at least two major versions unless security-critical.

## Quality Gates

All features MUST pass these gates before implementation:

- **Specification Review**: Requirements are clear, testable, and aligned with user needs
- **Architecture Review**: Technical approach supports maintainability and performance goals
- **Security Review**: Security implications assessed and mitigated appropriately
- **Performance Impact**: Resource usage and response time implications evaluated
- **Backward Compatibility**: Migration strategy defined for any breaking changes

## Technical Governance

Technology decisions MUST be guided by these principles:

- **Simplicity First**: Choose the simplest solution that meets requirements
- **Proven Technologies**: Prefer established, well-supported tools and frameworks
- **Long-term Viability**: Consider maintenance burden and community support
- **Team Capability**: Align with team expertise or provide adequate training
- **Documentation**: All architectural decisions MUST be documented with rationale

Quality standards MUST be enforced through automated tooling where possible. Code formatting, linting, security scanning, and testing MUST be integrated into CI/CD pipelines. Manual reviews MUST focus on logic, design, and architectural concerns rather than style issues.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All feature specifications, implementation plans, and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complexity that violates these principles MUST be explicitly justified with business rationale and technical necessity.

Amendments require: (1) documented rationale for change, (2) impact assessment on existing features, (3) migration plan for affected components, and (4) team consensus. Emergency exceptions may be granted for security-critical issues but MUST include remediation timeline.
